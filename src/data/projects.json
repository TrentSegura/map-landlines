Serving as M12’s HQ for the Landlines Initiative, the site is part of a multi-generation family ranch of nearly 500 acres. Ronald Rael and family grow hay, manage historic acequias, and preserve historic adobe structures throughout Southern Colorado. In collaboration with Rael, M12 utilizes part of the ranch to invite contributors to work in and with the living material around Conejos County, one of the five poorest counties in Colorado, but culturally one of its richest. The unique physical geography, cultural and economic diversity, and extraordinary environmental phenomena all enhance our work on the Landlines Initiative.

Duran tells us, “Growing up, I always knew this place was special in a way that I could not easily articulate. It wasn’t until I returned to the valley after a 20-year absence, that I began to find the words.” For Landlines, Duran is focused on La Botica, a region rich in botanical diversity located in a remote part of the south valley. La Botica is an archaeological site with a unique ecological setting that sits on a shelf that cannot be seen from the canyon below or the plains above. For Landlines, Duran will share the unique geology and biology of La Botica as well as the stories of the people who visited the land over the past several hundred years."},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.87673326457147,37.46810043923201]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"Land of Spirits","artist":"Elliot Ross","description":"Elliot Ross is a Ft.

All these features contribute to a very “scenic” quality to the San Luis Valley. Andrew takes us into the valley through lidar and spatial scanning helping us to understand the geological processes that created them. As Andrew says, “when you see a beautiful landscape, you're not only seeing shapes, shadows, and scale, you're seeing a story about its formation and why it is there.”"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.52831649780273,37.74139927315054]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"artist":"Chip Thomas ","title":"La Isla Schoolhouse and Fort Garland Murals","description":""},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.9272,37.1054]}}]}
